# Project status

Update this at the end of each substantive session. Identify things by commit and hash, not by date.

**Phase:** v0.4.0 is public: tag on `main` at `957cfe1` (merge of PR #4), image `scrumpis/dndsr@sha256:f1b42d9d338b406ec23daca1bb146ed0329db29d21a24a6871158996aa0572da`, version DOI 10.5281/zenodo.23903253 (concept DOI 10.5281/zenodo.23879469, used in `README.md` and `CITATION.cff`, resolves to the latest). Its software trees (`R`, `inst`, `NAMESPACE`, `DESCRIPTION`) are identical to `5983405`. `dev` names the v0.4.0 image. Checkpoints are in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## Identity

dndsR is a real R package, fit for CRAN one day, and a containerized CLI, for people and AI agents equally, with ease of use first.

## Next

1. The maintainer pushes `dev`, which swaps the v0.4.0 digest into `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, the tutorial, and the skill (RELEASE.md step 3), and merges it to `main` by pull request when convenient. Until then, `main`'s documents name the v0.3.0 image, which has the same dependencies.
2. The v0.4.0 GitHub release has no assets. RELEASE.md step 4 expects the workflow's `release-manifest.json` and skill tarball attached; the maintainer can attach them from the `publish` run, 41565720097.
3. This software is frozen for the Chenopodium analysis, which needs no rerun: `verify_release_equivalence.sh` reports the analysis's software identical to `v0.4.0`. Its work and results live outside this repository, and nothing from them comes here.
4. For v1.0.0: `docs/dev/ROADMAP-1.0.md`. Do not start it for the current manuscript.
