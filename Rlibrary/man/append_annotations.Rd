append_annotations(
  dnds_file = NULL,
  query_gff = NULL,
  subject_gff = NULL,
  output_file = NULL,
  comparison_file = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{dnds_file}{Path to a dN/dS TSV (single mode).}

\item{query_gff, subject_gff}{Paths to GFF3 files (single mode).}

\item{output_file}{Optional output path (single mode).}

\item{comparison_file}{Path to whitespace-delimited file (tabs/spaces; header or not)
with columns: comparison_name, query_fasta, query_gff, subject_fasta, subject_gff.
If provided, batch mode is used and outputs are written beside each dN/dS file.}

\item{output_dir}{Root directory containing per-comparison folders (batch mode).}

\item{custom}{Optional comma-separated patterns like "REX{5},TOM{8}" meaning
PREFIX followed by exactly N digits; produces q_prefix/s_prefix columns.}
